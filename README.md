## About application

The application is able to enter commands and perform appropriate operations depending on the command that has been chosen by the user. The data for our program is stored in a text file `tasks.csv` in CSV format.
All tasks are presented in the following format:
> Simple task - very important, 2020-03-09, true

The application has the following features:
> - displaying all available tasks
> - exit from the application
> - adding a new task
> - deleting a task
> - loading data from a file at application startup
> - saving data to the file
> - validating a numeric value when removing

In this micro-project I used virtually all the things that I've learned during my first week in the bootcamp held by [CodersLab](https://coderslab.pl/pl/), such as:
> - methods
> - data loading
> - multidimensional arrays
> - reading files
> - saving data to files
> - import and use of external libraries.
